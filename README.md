# healthnet-block

A healthcare prototype application in Blockchain


--------


# Prerequisites

    - Docker & docker-composer
    - Hyperledger Fabric Tools
    - Nodejs version: `8.16` (9.x & 10.x are yet incompatible with some components)

    - Hyperledger-compose
    - yo (yeoman)
    - npm or yarn

    running the prerequisites script will automatically get the above components and you can skip this step and go through setup
        - Since the script installs node via nvm u need to make sure no other runtime is the system (like `nodejs` from snap pckg manager)

# Setup
